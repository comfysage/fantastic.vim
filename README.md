# pascal.vim

This is a fork of [vim-colors-plain](https://github.com/andreypopp/vim-colors-plain) which is being developed based on my
personal taste.

## Motivation

Minimalistic colorscheme which uses bold to highlight keywords and a
distinguished color for constant literals (string, numbers, JSX tags).

<!-- TODO #1 Add screenshots @CrispyBaccoon -->

## Installation & Usage

With [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) you add this to your `.vimrc` / `init.vim`:

```Vim
Plug 'crispybaccoon/pascal.vim'
```

Then:

```Vim
set background=dark " Set to light for a light variant
colorscheme pascal
```
